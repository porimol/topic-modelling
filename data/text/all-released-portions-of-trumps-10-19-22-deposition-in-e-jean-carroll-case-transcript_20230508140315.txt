Yeah.


Around that time, yes.


Maybe a year later.


That’s right.


57th and Fifth.


Yes.


59th off Fifth Avenue.


I don’t know the years. About five years.


In the early ’90s.


I don’t know. I don’t know what you… You’d have to define social life. I wouldn’t say that busy. I was working very hard so I didn’t have time to be too much onto the social calendar, but yeah.


A lot of charity events, yes. But I don’t think that much, no.


Yes.


That’s right.


Yes.


Yes.


I did everything.


I did the late night shows. I did the newscasts. I even did some of the political shows on Sunday, even though I wasn’t really in politics as I am now. But they wanted me to do that and I did that. They’d asked me to do them all the time, so I did quite a bit of television.


A little bit.


Yes.


Little bit.


Probably. But I wasn’t much involved at that point in the television industry, but I probably did.


Maybe Bob Wright?


He was the head of NBC, I think, at that time.


Later.


More in the seven, eight year ago period.


So about ’78 to the early ’90s.


Right.


I’d have to get the exact dates for you. I can do that very easily.


Not much, actually.


If it was a birthday or something, I guess, yeah.


It’s possible, but I don’t think very much. No.


Yes, generally.


It’s probable.


I don’t know.


No, I don’t think I was public about it.


I don’t think I was public about it even if… I don’t think I was public about it at all.


I don’t know. It was toward the end of the marriage, so I don’t know really. It could be there could be a lap over, but I don’t really know.


Very rarely.


Almost for me, almost never. I would very rarely go there.


I don’t know. It’s possible I was there, but I don’t know that I ever shopped there for myself.


I don’t think I ever shopped for others. It’s possible that one or both of my wives shopped there a little bit, but I don’t remember ever buying something for myself at Bergdorf Goodman. I went there very seldom, almost if ever.


That’s right.


Yeah.


No.


Okay.


Excuse me?


No, I don’t believe I did.


Nope. Never have. Never. I’ve never seen the book, actually.


I think so.


Yes.


Essentially, that’s what I said. Yeah.


Yeah.


Yeah.


Yeah.


Yeah.


Yes.


Yes.


Yes.


Looks like it.


It looks like it.


Yes.


Vaguely, yes.


I think it was in the Oval Office.


Yes, I do.


Yes.


Yes, I do.


I didn’t have to reach out to anybody because it didn’t happen. And by the way, if it did happen, it would’ve been reported within minutes. Talking about going to a major floor, probably I assume the most important floor, a major floor in a major department store, that’s a very busy store, by the way and check out counters and everything else. And I would be in there. It’s the most ridiculous, disgusting story. It was just made up.


After the statement was made? No.


Yes.


It was a true statement when I made it. I think subsequently, or at some point they showed a picture on a receiving that I was on a celebrity line for a charity, and I think I was either shaking her hand or her husband’s hand on a receiving line. Like I say, I shake a lot of hands with people, but I had no idea who she was.


Along with a lot of other things.


This was a very public… I think it was a charity or a celebrity event or something, and I think that’s her.


Big claim to fame, that she shook my hand at some celebrity event.


At some point I saw there was a photo on a receiving line. Yes.


I think so, yes.


At some point during the process I saw it. That’s, I guess, her husband, John Johnson, who was an anchor for ABC. Nice guy. I thought, I mean, I don’t know him, but I thought he was pretty good at what he did. I don’t even know who the woman, let’s see. I don’t know who. It’s Marla.


That’s Marla. Yeah. That’s my wife.


Here.


Who is that? Who is this?


I don’t know.


If this was the picture, I assume that’s John Johnson. Is that…


… Carroll? Because it’s very blurry.


Yeah, that’s right.


No.


No.


No.


No.


No idea.


I just don’t know. It’s possible somebody, when they heard this horrible accusation, it’s possible that somebody did a little quick research, but not that I know of.


Yeah.


No. I didn’t know that.


No.


I don’t know.


I don’t know. Yeah.


I saw her in a picture. I didn’t know what she looked like. And I said it, and I say it with as much respect as I can, but she is not my type.


Physically, she’s not my type. And now that I’ve gotten indirectly to hear things about her, she wouldn’t be my type in any way, shape, or form.


I saw a photo of her. And the only difference between me and other people is I’m honest, she’s not my type.


It’s a platform that’s been opened by me as an alternative to Twitter.


I believe so, yes.


I believe so, yes.


I did.


Yeah.


Yes.


Yes. It’s called Truth and Post. We post much like… How would you say it? We put out a statement and we also put it on Truth.


I can’t read this.


I can see it, yeah.


Great statement, yeah. True, true.


I wrote it all myself. All myself.


That’s right.


I still don’t know this woman. I think she’s a whack jab. I have no idea. I don’t know anything about this woman other than what I read in stories and what I hear. I know nothing about her.


That’s right. I still don’t.


Oh, yes. That I know, but I know nothing about her. I think she’s sick. Mentally sick.


That would be a word, maybe accurate or not, having to do with talking to her and talking to do an act that she said happened, which didn’t happen. And it’s a nicer word than the word that starts with an F. And this would be a word that I used because I thought it would be inappropriate to use the other word, and it didn’t happen.


Well, sort of that’s what she said I did to her. She fainted with great emotion. She actually indicated that she loved it. Okay? She loved it until commercial break. In fact, I think she said it was sexy, didn’t she? “It was very sexy to be raped.” Didn’t she say that?


Well, based on her interview with Anderson Cooper, I believe that’s what took place. We can define that. You’ll have to show that. I’m sure you’re going to show that. But she was interviewed by Anderson Cooper, and I think she said that rape was sexy, which it’s not, by the way, but I think she said that rape was sexy. She actually said things that were very strange and then she was a different person after the… When he said, “We’ll take a break right now, we’re going to take a break right now,” he didn’t like what she was saying. He was very upset with what… And then she came back and she was a much different woman, in the second half, so to speak.


Well, she said something to that effect. You’ll have to take a look at the interview yourself. I believe she said rape was sexy, to which Anderson Cooper is dying. He’s saying, “Let’s get to a commercial break immediately.” I think you better watch the interview. I’m sure you have, but you better watch the interview.


Oh, I don’t know. I mean, I don’t know. All I know is I believe she said “rape is sexy” or something to that effect, but you’ll have to watch the interview. It’s been a while.


Yeah. That’s because that’s what she said.


No. She said that I did something to her that never took place. There was no anything. I know nothing about this nut job.


Because it’s not politically correct to say… Read the next, go ahead. That she’s not my type? Yeah, because it’s not politically correct to say it. And I know that, but I’ll say it anyway. She’s accusing me of rape, a woman that I have no idea who she is. It came out of the blue. She’s accusing me of rape, of raping her, the worst thing you can do, the worst charge. And you know it’s not true, too. You’re a political operative also, you’re a disgrace. But she’s accusing me, and so are you, of rape, and it never took place. And I will tell you, I made that statement and I said, “Well, it’s politically incorrect, she’s not my type.” And that’s a 100% true. She’s not my type.


Yeah.


Yes, totally.


100%.


Yes, I do.


Could be. I’ve had a lot of hoaxes played on me. This is one of them.


A fake story, a false story, a made-up story.


Something that’s not true, yes.


Sure. The Russia-Russia-Russia hoax. It’s been proven to be a hoax. Ukraine-Ukraine-Ukraine hoax. The Mueller situation for two and a half years hoax, ended in “no collusion.” It was a whole big hoax. The lying to the Pfizer Court hoax. The lying to Congress many times hoax by all these people, this scum that we have in our country. Lying to Congress hoax. The spying on my campaign hoax. They spied on my campaign and now they admit it. That was another hoax. And I could get a whole list of them. And this is a hoax too.


This ridiculous situation that we’re doing right, it’s a big fat hoax. She’s a liar and she’s a sick person, in my opinion. Really sick. Something wrong with her.


Yeah, I do. Sure, I do. They’re very dishonest. Mail-in ballots? Very dishonest.


I do. I do. Sometimes I do, but I don’t know what happens to it once you give it. I have no idea.


Yes, I am.


You know, and-


I moved on her, actually. She was down on Palm Beach. I moved on her and I failed. I’ll admit it.


I did try and fuck her. She was married.


You know, Nancy. This was-


And I moved on her very heavily. In fact, I took her out furniture shopping. She wanted to get some furniture. I said, “I’ll show you where they have some nice furniture.” I took her out furniture… I moved on her like a bitch but I couldn’t get there, and she was married. Then all of a sudden, I see her. She’s now got the big phony tits and everything. She’s totally changed her looks.


Whoa!


Whoa!


That is you very-


Look at you. You are a [inaudible 00:36:57].


It’s very funny.


You and I will walk out.


Maybe it’s a different one.


Yeah, that’s her with the gold. I better use some Tic Tacs just in case I start kissing her. I’m automatically attracted to beautiful- I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. I don’t even wait. And when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.


Grab them by the [inaudible 00:37:33]. You can do anything.


Oh, it looks good.


Oh, nice legs, huh?


It’s always good if you don’t fall out of the bus. Like Ford, Gerald Ford. Remember?


Hello, how are you? Hi.


Good seeing you. Terrific.


Terrific. You know Billy Bush.


We’re ready. Let’s go. Make me a soap star.


Okay, absolutely. Melania said this was okay.


Yes, yes.


I guess that would… I don’t know the date, but whatever date it was is fine with me.


I don’t know.


I don’t know relative to that tape, no.





That’s right.


This is very old news. Fully litigated during debates, during everything else. Fully litigated.


And you know what I said then? And I say it now, locker room talk. That was locker room talk.


That’s what goes on.


Excuse me?


I did say that, yes, absolutely.


We actually did look for furniture, yes.


I think so, I mean, it’s been a long time ago. How long was that? A long time ago, but I think so. I do think so.


I think so.


Well, historically, that’s true with stars.


Well, if you look over the last million years, I guess that’s been largely true. Not always, but largely true. Unfortunately or fortunately.


I think you can say that.


It’s locker room talk.


No, it’s locker room talk. I don’t know. It’s just the way people talk.


No.


You’ll have to give me a little bit of a background.


Oh, I do remember. There was some woman that wrote, and then she, a long time later, I think she wrote a wonderful story. And then a long time later, as I remember it, a long time later, she said that I was aggressive with her. But she wrote the most beautiful story and then all of a sudden, is it a year or two years later? She comes out with this phony story that I was, I said, “Well, why would she have written such a good story for People Magazine?” She wrote a really nice piece and then all of a sudden, years or months, many months later, she came up with this phony charge.


Then there was a writer from People Magazine who wrote a story on Melania and myself on our first anniversary. The story was beautiful. It was beautiful. It was lovely. But last night we hear that after 12 years, this took place 12 years ago this story, a new claim that I made inappropriate advances during the interview to this writer. And I ask a very simple question, why wasn’t it part of the story that appeared 20 or 12 years ago? Why wasn’t it part of the story? Why didn’t they make it part of the story?(43:08)I was one of the biggest stars on television with The Apprentice and it would’ve been one of the biggest stories of the year. Think of it. She’s doing this story on Melania, who’s pregnant at the time, and Donald Trump, our one year anniversary. She said I made inappropriate advances. And by the way, the area was a public area. People all over the place take a look. You take a look. Look at her. Look at her words. You tell me what you think. I don’t think so. I don’t think so.


Yes.


No, I don’t think so. Explain. Go ahead.


Yes. This woman made up a story just like your client made it up. Just made up a story having to do with sitting next to me in an airplane. And I mean, I’ll have to read this again, but that story was so false also. But this was, I guess making out as opposed to what your client said. This story was so false. This is a disgrace also.


I might have. I thought it was so, like your client, I thought it was so ridiculous.


Hopefully our great movement, and there’s never been anything like this in the United States, and the only way they figured they can slow it down is to come up with people that are willing to say, “Oh, I was with Donald Trump in 1980.”(45:17)Nothing changes.(45:17)“I was sitting with him on an airplane and he went after me on the plane.” I’m going to go after her. Believe me, she would not be my first choice that I can tell you. Man, you don’t know. That would not be my first choice.


Just the overall. I look at her, I see her, I hear what she says, whatever. You wouldn’t be a choice of mine either, to be honest with you. I hope you’re not insulted. I would not under any circumstances have any interest in you. I’m honest when I say it,. She, I would not have any interest in.


I don’t know. I think I probably saw her on television or something, but I don’t want to be insulting, but when people accuse me of something, I think I have a right to be insulting because they’re insulting me. They’re doing the ultimate insult. They’re making up stories and then I’m not allowed to speak my mind. No, I disagree with that. No, she would not have been anywhere on a list. It just wouldn’t have been for me.


It’s disgusting. What she said was disgusting. Can you imagine doing that on an airplane? What she said? I’m doing that on an airplane. That’s almost as ridiculous as doing it in Bergdorf Goodman in a dressing room.


No, no, no. We’re talking about a different thing. We’re talking about a woman where something happened that was inappropriate, right? Inappropriate, was highly inappropriate. She would remember that date. I would imagine she would’ve complained to the airline. She would know the flight. She would know everything about it. She didn’t even know the year as I remember it. Just like your client doesn’t know the year. Doesn’t know anything about it. If something happened like that to your client, your client would know the second. She’d know down to the second. She’d know the day, the month, the year, right down to the second.


Last paragraph, where?


Go ahead. What is it?


Yeah.


Yeah. And I think their attorneys too. I think the attorneys like you are a big part of it because you know it’s a phony case.
