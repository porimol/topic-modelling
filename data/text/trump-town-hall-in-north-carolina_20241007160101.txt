Thank you. Where do you want? Which side are you taking?


Okay. Okay, got it.


Thank you very much. Hello, everybody. How are you? Hi, darling. Hi. How are you?


Thank you very much, everybody. This is an honor. And I walked in, the first question that I asked-


… “Should we change the name from Fort Liberty back to Fort Bragg?” First question, right? So, here’s what we do. We get elected, I’m doing it. I’m doing it. I’m doing it. And we’re leading in all the polls. We should get elected. But remember this, they cheat like hell. We got to, “Too big to rig.” We need, “Too big to rig.” So, I just appreciate being here. We did win two world wars from Fort Bragg, right? Look at that big guy. This is no time to be changing names. But we’re going to do that. We’re going to do everything we can. We’re going to get it back. We’re going to bring our country back. We’re going to bring our country back. Thank you, everybody. Let’s have a little fun, right?


Okay.


Don’t even care what it is, yeah. Go ahead.


I love them. I love them. And Kamala should be here. She shouldn’t be anywhere else.


And they’re missing a billion dollars that they gave to migrants coming into our country. Some of them are murderers, some of them are drug dealers, some of them, many of them. 13,099 murderers came into our country-


… during the three and a half… And we’re missing a billion dollars. They gave them to the migrants that came in, and now we don’t have the money. We’ll do it, but they don’t have the money to take care of this. They’ve given you lousy treatment in North Carolina in particular, and we don’t like that, so we’re going to let it be known, and they have to get a lot better because people are not happy.


I’ll tell you, she is my friend too. And she is my friend.


She’s my friend. Say that.


Good going. Great.


Come here. Stay here. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. So, it was nine years ago, and my beautiful wife, our first lady, she… We love our first lady. Did you see her interview on Sean Hannity and with Ainsley in the morning? She did great. But nine years ago, she came to me, she said, “There are two women, and they are really incredible.” I said, “Who the hell are they?” I said, “You got to see this. You’re not going to believe it.” They had a thing, and we fell in love almost immediately.


And her sister was just unbelievable too.


And she passed away a couple of years ago now.


It’s a long time ago, it seems. It goes fast, right?


But what a great combination. We love you both. They were loyal to me from day one.


When they heard stuff, they said, “That’s a lot of crap.”


They were with me from day one.


And that Trump sign gets bigger and bigger. I said, “That’s so nice. I want to buy one for myself.” But I just-


You know what?


You know what? We appreciate your loyalty, your friendship.


And I saw Silk backstage. I said, “I’m bringing you upstage. I’m going to bring you upstage.” And we miss your great sister. And we love you. And thank you very much. Thank you.


Thank you. Thank you. Great.


Yeah. I’m going to be very careful with these things.


These seats weren’t designed for me exactly.


Hi.


Thank you, Ali.


So, let me just tell you that you’re right about that. It’s 13,099, to be exact, and murderers. Many of these people murdered more than one person. One did seven. These are not people we want in our country. So this was, I guess, released by somebody that loves us, maybe in Border Patrol. We don’t know exactly where the numbers… But these are certified numbers. And you had 16,000 drug traffickers. You had numbers that nobody’s ever seen. 645,000 criminals overall. They’re in our country. Nobody has any idea. They’re from places unknown. Nobody knows who they are, what they are. But we know that we have over 600,000 people released into our country, along with the ones that you were talking about, the 21,000. But of them, 13,000, more than 13,000, are murders. And some were on schedule to die. They were scheduled toward the death penalty. And we have them now nicely ensconced in our country.(11:53)I’ll tell you what, we have the worst president and the worst vice president in the history of America. They are horrible. They are horrible, that that could happen. And just the concept of open borders doesn’t makes sense. We built 500 miles of wall. More. And we were going to add another 200, much more than I said I was going to do. And that’s why we had the best numbers ever. Ooh, the chart. So, you know the chart? My favorite chart, Ali. My favorite piece of paper, my favorite chart, but we had a chart. Do you have something up here that you could show? I love that chart. Oh, I love that chart. If I didn’t look to the right, I wouldn’t be going to Butler tomorrow. We’re going to Butler tomorrow. If I didn’t look over…(12:38)So no, but if you look at the chart, at the arrow on the bottom, that shows the lowest number in the history of our country. That was the day I left office. And these clowns took over, and what they’ve done to our country, between that and so many other things, what they’ve done to our country. But inflation was the worst we’ve ever had, I think. They say, “Oh, it was only 48 years.” Somebody, one of the fake news back there, they corrected me one time. They said, “No, 48 years.” “Oh, okay.” But it wasn’t. I believe it was the worst that we’ve ever had.


And that’s been one of the big problems. But to me, and I know that you talk about the bad economy, you talk about all the costs and the costs are so bad, to me, the worst is the border, because it’s like what they’re doing is they’re destroying our country. And it’s not easy. We’re going to get them out. We’re going to have the largest deportation in history. I’m not proud to say that either, but it’s a tough thing to do.(13:34)And Ana, we’re going to get the criminals out. We’re going to start with the worst of them, and we’re going to get them out. And you know what’s going to help us? Local law enforcement. Local law enforcement. They’re going to be great. They know their names, they know their serial numbers. We’re going to get them out. And very simply, we have a little thing called MAGA. Everybody, who knows MAGA? It’s called Make America Great Again. That’s what we’re going to do. We’re going to make America great again. Thank you, darling. Really good question. Thank you.


It’s an incredible community that we… I don’t know. It’s just very energetic. You know that, right? It’s energetic. And they’re very entrepreneurial, and they love our country. And we have, we’ve gotten record numbers with the Hispanic community. And I don’t know. It just works.


It just works. So, I appreciate it very much. Thank you. Thank you, darling, very much.


Okay.


Hi. Good-looking guy.


That’s good stuff, right. That’s good. That’s good.


So, I want to have them come back into the military with pay. And they’ve been talking about that, but it never happened. They never did what they said they were going to do. There should have never been a mandate. That should have never happened. You should have been given choices, we say. We want choice in education, and we want a choice there, too. And that should have never happened. And we’ve lost some of our best people in the military too. Did you leave? Did you leave?


Did you ever take the vaccine or anything?


So, you wanted choice. Yeah. Would you go back in if they were able to?


Yeah. No, there would be accountability. That’s right. We’ll fire their asses. But they will pay. We don’t want to lose this guy. He’s central casting. We want to get him back in. Yeah. We’re going to take care of it. I hope you do come back, or I hope you’re doing very well outside, to be honest. Wherever you are, I just want you to do well.(16:25)But we’re going to get a lot of people coming back. They should have never had the mandate. The mandate was a big mistake, and they treated people terribly. Terribly. Okay? Thank you very much. Great.


You look great. Thank you. We lost a lot of great people. Also, another, in police forces, I mean, a lot of people were forced into doing things they didn’t want to do. But I love that question. That’s a great question. Thank you very much.


Thank you. Thank you very much. And I’ll tell you, we have a great military. We really do. But Walter Reed, you mentioned the name, and that hospital is unbelievable. The doctors are unbelievable. They had a lot of problems with getting there, getting to it, managerially, getting into see… But we had the best doctors. They could do things that nobody else could do, and they got to see some really badly hurt people. And the level of talent at Walter Reed, it’s just an incredible hospital. So we have to pay our due respects. You hear so much about government-owned or whatever, I don’t think there’s a better hospital in the world than Walter Reed. So we should say that, right?


That was good.


Thank you.


Fort Bragg-


Are you not? You’re not a soldier now?


Yeah. You are? Okay. Good.


I love it. I mean, I love it. I love it. We’re going to have it. One of the things I say, we’re going to have an Iron Dome. Why should we have an Iron Dome? And you see how effective… So the other day, 287 big ballistic missiles were shot into Israel. Every single one of them was taken down. Well, why shouldn’t we have that? And it’s all going to be made in the United States with our technology. It’s all going to be made in the US. And a lot of it’s going to be made in a place called North Carolina, if you don’t mind. Okay?(19:40)And I think I just learned the secret… Look, we’re going to win. I believe you got to get out there, you got to vote, and all that. But I think I just learned the secret to winning absolutely and by massive margins. I’m going to promise to you, as I said at the beginning, that we’re going to change the name back to Fort Bragg, because I think when that word gets out, I just see this great-looking soldier just accidentally said Fort Liberty and he got almost booed the hell out of the place. That was not good. Anyway, I believe it’s absolutely something that we want to have for safety. We’re a target for a lot of different places. I listened to Biden yesterday… Since I went under the wing. You know I used to go under the wing in the aircraft? Nobody ever did that before I did. All of a sudden, Biden started, but he only takes a half a question he usually can’t answer. But they asked him, “What do you think about Iran? Would you hit Iran?”(20:55)And he goes, “As long as they don’t hit the nuclear stuff.” That’s the thing you want to hit, right? I said, “I think he’s got that one wrong. Isn’t that what you’re supposed to hit?” I mean, it’s the biggest risk we have. Nuclear weapons. The power of nuclear weapons. The power of weaponry. I rebuilt the entire military. Jets, everything, I built… Including nuclear, and I hated to build the nuclear, but I got to know firsthand the power of that stuff. And I’ll tell you what, we have to be totally prepared. We have to be absolutely prepared. But when they asked him that question, the answer should have been hit the nuclear first and worry about the rest later. And that’s [inaudible 00:21:40]. If they’re going to do it, they’re going to do it, but we’ll find out whatever their plans are. But great question. Thank you very much. Thank you.


I agree. I agree.


So a lot of things are happening very fast. And we could end up in World War III before we get there. The way it’s going right now… Look at Russia with Ukraine. That’s a disaster. Look at the Middle East, it’s exploding all over the place. And we have people that… Look, we have a president that has… He spends most of his time on the beach sleeping. I never saw a guy could sleep in front of a camera. Does anybody think of it? I don’t sleep that much. I toss and turn, I think, I think, I think. I’m always thinking. Do you ever do that? You’re sweating and you’re thinking and you trying to figure out how to beat this one that… Look, how to make our country great. But I toss and I turn. This guy just falls asleep in the beach like there’s nothing to it. I wish I had that ability. That’s one ability he has that I do not have. And I wouldn’t mind having it. I could use a little extra sleep.(23:03)But we are going to do things with our country. You just have to be respected again. Viktor Orban is… A lot of fake news back there, by the way. But the fake news, still they call him a strong man. He’s the head of Hungary, and he’s very strong guy, very tough guy. But, I mean, more than anything, that’s a very smart guy. And they said, “Why is the world blowing up? You have the Middle East that’s blowing up, you have Russia, Ukraine, that could lead to catastrophe. You talk about nuclear weapons, that could be a total catastrophe. Why is it… He said, “If you put Trump back in the White House, it’s all going to end. You’re going to have peace.” We had four years. We didn’t have any wars. We didn’t have terrorists, we didn’t have anything. And I will tell you exactly what he said… Maybe I will. He said, “Because they were afraid of Trump. I don’t want to be the one saying that. But they were probably afraid of him because they couldn’t…(24:04)They think I was crazy. And that’s a good thing to think, right, soldier? They said, “This guy is crazy.” But, no, he said that, “You put Trump back in the White House, you’re not going to have all of that stuff [inaudible 00:24:17]. October 7th would’ve never happened. The attack on Israel would’ve never happened. Remember, Iran was broke. They weren’t giving money to Hezbollah. They weren’t giving money to anybody. Any of these… They call them delegates of terror, a lot of different names, but it’s always of terror. And there was no money for Hamas. And now you look, we had no… You know because you were such a big part of it, we had no attacks, we had no terrorism, we had no nothing. For four years, we had… And I wanted to talk about it during the four years, but that’s never smart. Right, Robert? That’s never smart to do. So I didn’t. But I talk about it a lot now. We had no attacks. We had none of this stuff going on.(24:58)We defeated ISIS, by the way. We took ISIS, we defeated that in four weeks. It was supposed to take five years. I rebuilt the military and we had a military, and we have great generals. Not the television guys, by the way. The real generals. I’m talking about Raisin Caine. General Raisin Caine. You know who that is. But we defeated ISIS quickly. It was supposed to take five years, we did it in four weeks. We have a great military. And we have a military that’s not woke. You may have a few people on the top that are woke and we’re going to get rid of them so damn fast, you’re head’s going to explode.


Well, even China likes us back. China wants to see a little stability too. But I charged China hundreds of billions of dollars in taxes and tariffs and they paid it. And frankly, we had a good relationship with President Xi, but they paid hundreds of billions of dollars. No other president got them to pay 10 cents. Literally, not 10 cents. Hundreds of billions of dollars. And you know what? More importantly, they respected your country. They don’t respect us anymore. They respected your country and they’ll respect us again.


Hi, Sarah.


Wow.


Is he here? No? Is-


Good. That’s great.


It’s such a great question, and thank you. And what a good wife that is, and I’ll bet your husband’s great. You love your husband, right? You know the people like you… What is your first name?


Sarah? People like Sarah are so important to our country because they take care of people that are great heroes, real heroes. And if the hospitals would be unable to do it, they just would be this right now. I mean, with all of the migrants, the migrants have taken over our hospitals, they’ve taken over [inaudible 00:28:08] we don’t have anything. But people like Sarah, the job they do is incredible. And they do it out of pure love. They don’t do it for any other reason. They do it out of pure love. And we have to help them. We have to help them because the medical costs would be unaffordable by our nation. It would be totally unaffordable. And it was better before, and I heard it sliding. I spoke with Robert before and… Who did, by the way, an incredible job. You did an incredible… Just stand up, please.(28:31)And, Sarah, we had… Thank you, Robert. We had a 92% approval rating at the beginning, 92%. Now it’s down into the 40s. We had a thing called Choice where if you had to wait too long for a doctor… You know the story. If you got to wait too long, guys were waiting four, five, six months. They go in with a minor problem, they end up being terminally ill because they didn’t take care of it. It could have been taken care of with a shot, with a pill, with a minor operation. They end up dying. And we changed it. And we had Choice. We also had accountability. Remember? Accountability. So in Choice, they tried to get it for 52 years accountability, for 58 years accountability. You couldn’t fire anybody in the VA. And I said, “That’s no good, because you had sadists in the VA, you had bad people in the… We had some bad people. And we fired about 9,000 people and we replaced them with 9,000 good, loving people that love our heroes, right? That love our patriotic heroes.(29:32)And that was a big thing. And I just said to Robert, “How’s it going nowadays? How is it going?” And he said, “They’re getting rid of Choice rapidly.” Choice is when you can’t see a doctor rapidly, you go outside, you find a doctor, you get yourself fixed up. And, Sarah, we pay the bill. And it was a great thing. And he said it’s rapidly not being used, not being allowed to be used. And I think it actually didn’t cost… I think, in the end, we probably saved on it. But money isn’t the big thing here. I think, actually, we saved money on it because people would get very, very sick. These are people that would wait four, five, six months to see a doctor. If you had to wait more than one day, you go out, you see a doctor, we had bills negotiated, fees negotiated. We can’t be totally crazy with this because the doctors are pretty good business people, I will tell you. Right? But we had a lot of fees negotiated. But you go out, see a doctor, get yourself fixed up and you have no problems.(30:32)It was one of the best things we ever did. And now this group of lunatics that don’t give a damn about the military, they’re making you go through that waiting of four, five, six months again, and our people can’t… We have great doctors, but they can’t handle the loads. And we get back in, we’re going back to that, right? We’re going back to it immediately. You’re going to be in great shape, Sarah. You and your husband are going to be in great shape. And thank you very much. Incredible.


Thank you. Hi, Dwight. Whoa. Looks like a check. It’s a check. It’s cash.


That’s right. That’s right.


Thank you. Thank you very much.


Yeah, I’ll hold that [inaudible 00:32:26]. He doesn’t do this, but he’s better than anybody as far as I’m…


I said why was there so much blood to the doctor, and it’s bleeding like crazy. This is a little fact, some of you might’ve heard this, but you get hit in the ear and it bleeds more than any other part of the body. So I didn’t mind being hit that way. I don’t want to be hit that way. This way. This way. If I didn’t make the turn, I wouldn’t have been hit the other way. That’s no good. That would not have been too good. But it is true. And I got very lucky. And maybe it wasn’t so much luck. Maybe there’s something else, right? Maybe there’s something else out there. But that’s great. Thank you.


Well, it was a great honor, and I remember very well when you gave it.


[inaudible 00:33:58]. Thank you.


Really nice, thank you.


No, you didn’t.


It’s so interesting. So one of the things that most angers me about this is the 21 million people plus. They say it’s 10, it’s 12, whether it is or not, it’s much more than that. It’s 21 million and it’s probably with the got-aways and everything got more that. But one of the things that most angers me is that you have veterans on the streets in front of a hotel and you have illegal immigrants, some of them are serious killers and drug dealers and all the people that we talked about before and terrorists and those people are being walked into a hotel and they’re staying in a hotel and they walk by veterans who are sleeping on the street. And it could be cold, it could be hot. And it bothers me, if we stop, if we close our walls, we’re going to be able to handle it. They are spending so much money on taking care of the illegal migrants.(35:44)Now we call them, we used to call them illegal aliens. I call them whatever the hell I want to call them. So do you. But they’re not supposed to be here and we’re going to close the wall. First day we’re going to do a couple of things. First day we’re going to drill, baby drill. We’re going to close the wall, we’re going to close it up and we will be, we’re going to have to take people out. We cannot have killers.(36:08)Do we agree? Does anybody want to leave the murderers? The drug dealers in our country? Do you know one of the little facts that’s very sad, but makes sense that all these things I predicted three or four years ago, I would say this is going to happen and now it’s happening. The migrant crime, it is a massive crime, but all of this that’s happened, everybody, it’s common sense that it was going to happen and we’re going to have to get them out because we have no choice.(36:34)It is not sustainable by any country. We have done things that are so stupid, as an example, I consider it to be less important, but it’s very important still because it is a way of life. Men playing in women’s sports. Who wants that? And who wants open borders? Because open borders is so, you say, “How does a thing like that happen?” All of these policies we’re going to be changing. We have now somebody running as a radical left person, more left by far than Pocahontas. You know who that is? More left by far than crazy Bernie Sanders.(37:11)She’s more left and we can’t have it. So we are going to take care of your people and your friends. You’ve got a lot of friends out there that don’t have a place and we’re going to do it. And we’re going to do it faster. We’re going to put money to it. First of all, we’re standing on the greatest power, it’s called liquid gold. We have more than any other country. We don’t use it. We get oil and gas now from Venezuela. Do you believe it?(37:35)We’re going to take our own and we’re going to make a lot of money. So we’re going to make a lot of money. We’re going to take care of our veterans properly. We’re not going to have to have that happen any more.


Thank you. Beautiful guy, beautiful guy.(37:43)I think I’m going to stand. This chair is the most uncomfortable chair. First of all, it spins, and the one thing I don’t want is to fall on my ass because that’s going to be–. That will be the only story. They’ll say, sir, you did great. Too bad you fell. That would be the only story. So I’m not sitting in that sucker. I think it is a booby trap that was put there by Kamala.


But I don’t do it, I don’t do it really for a pure really great reason. I just do it because I want results. And I just find women to be smarter than men, does that make sense? Men, you don’t mind I do that every once in a while, it’s not bad. Thank you, thank you.


Anna, one thing, so Elon Musk, we all love Elon, you know, Elon. We have to take care of our brilliant people. We don’t have too many of them, right? There aren’t too many brilliant people.(44:03)But I got a call — an emergency call two days ago, — to speak to Elon. And he endorsed me very strongly. He endorses me almost every day. He wants us to win so badly.(44:15)But Elon is a brilliant guy between the Teslar and the Santa Rockets. But he also does something called, you know the links, Starlink. So he has Starlink. Now I’m not too familiar with it all I know is it really supposed to be great. So they called, because in North Carolina, in parts of North — and a little bit Georgia, but in parts of North Carolina, every line is down. There was no, there was no calls, no anything. Nobody could get through to anybody.(44:42)And I got a call from a big person in North Carolina, “Could you possibly call Elon Musk because we need help with Starlinks. Could we get Starlings? You know really? And I did, and he was great. And you know he did something that was… He had ordered. I got a call, during my phone call. They called me up, the people from North Carolina and they said, “Thank you very much for helping us with Mr. Musk.” I was talking to him. He wasn’t off the phone. I said, “Do you have some kind of a thing that we’re talking and you’re ordering?” This was the craziest thing. I’ve just, like he’s talking. So Elon, thank you very much. I appreciate it. I’ll see you. He’s going to Butler tomorrow. You know what Elon is going to Butler.(45:33)But I asked him about Starlinks, would you be able to get a certain section of Georgia? They’re going to fly him in with helicopters and everything else. Would you be able? And as I’m talking to him, they’re calling me on the other line thanking me for getting it. So I got to ask him what the hell that was all about, right?(45:40)He’s probably got some of the contraptions that he’s going like this as he’s talking to. He’s incredible that guy I’ll tell you. But he got a tremendous for Georgia and for North Carolina, the Starlinks, they got it and here’s the one thing they have to do. They have to distribute it. They have to get it out there. He got it here, but they have to get it out there. They’re not getting it out. That’s FEMA. They’ve got to get it out, it’s so important. But he’s really done a great job, so we appreciate it.


That’s great. Thank you.


Okay, it is great. I know more about that subject than any subject we spoke about because I think it was the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country.(47:18)There was never anything, I don’t think Putin would’ve gone in and invaded Ukraine if that didn’t happen. And he saw that. He said, “These people are stupid people, they’re idiots.” And they only respect power and force. When they saw that, by the way, if I were President, Putin would’ve never done it, period. And you would’ve never had the attack and you wouldn’t have had inflation and you wouldn’t have had the problem that we’re talking about. Because I had it down to 5,000. I was getting out. They were there for 20 years.(47:46)But a couple of things were done wrong. Number one, they should have kept the military base, right? Bagram. So you have a military base, one of the largest bases in the world. We left it. It is one hour, forget about Afghanistan, it’s one hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons, okay? You got to keep that. And they didn’t. They fled. They left.(48:05)We had, as you know, 18 months. I called up Abdul. Abdul is the head of the Taliban. That’s the one’s who do the shooting, okay? Not the Afghan. It’s called the Taliban. And the press said, why would you call him because that’s where the shooting is. And I called them up. We didn’t have, I was nasty. We didn’t have one soldier killed. Because they were killing a lot of our soldiers, the snipers, and a lot of them with the Obama-Biden administration before I got there. And a lot of them, and I called them up, had rough call. And after that call, we didn’t have one soldier killed for 18 months. We didn’t have one soldier shot at for 18 months.(48:45)And then we had a terrible election. We’re not going to let that happen again. We can’t ever let that happen again. We’re not going to have a… What a shame that was. But we had an election and these guys took over and it all started up again. And what they did with that withdrawal was so bad.(49:07)Number one, we lost 13 great soldiers. And as you know, I know the parents of a lot of them. But we lost the soldiers. We left 85 billion dollars worth of equipment behind. We left Americans behind. Everything was wrong and we embarrassed our country. I really mean it, I think it was most embarrassing. The one thing you do is you take the soldiers out last, okay? They took the soldiers at first, a five-year-old child would tell you that.(49:32)The other thing you do is you fire every general that was involved in that case because those guys were incompetent. And you haven’t heard the last of that. I promise you. You have not heard the last od that. What a terrible, what a terrible thing that was. Worse, one of the most embarrassing, me as a person that loves our country. That was the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, in my opinion. Thank you. We’re going to take care of that. I again, thank you.


You do know. She’s a Congresswoman, right? And a highly respected one. She’s actually a killer with her husband and the most beautiful baby you’ve ever seen backstage. But she’s a Congresswoman from Florida, and I have to say she’s a highly respected person.


Very good Terry. I appreciate it too. And it is very unfair. So I gave the largest pay raise in the history of the military, and I thought that was wonderful. But then when these clowns came in, these incompetent fools came in, they allowed inflation, and because of the energy policies, I think mostly, but also because of their spending, but they allowed massive inflation. So your pay stayed here and you were happy, and then all of a sudden the cost of bacon doubled, and the cost of everything else doubled and tripled and quadrupled, interest rates went to 10%, we were at 2% and they went to 10%, so you could no longer buy a house. So many things happened.(52:19)The answer is, yes, I’m going to take care of you, I’m going to take care of our law enforcement, and you know who else I’m going to take care of; our teachers. Our teachers are very underpaid. We’re going to take care of our teachers. Okay. And I did it. I felt strongly, but the fact is that what we gave you got wiped out by their inflation that they should have never had. That’s another thing. You would’ve never had inflation, because it was caused largely by really dumb energy. The energy went through the sky, that brought everything with it, so we’re going to take care. But law enforcement also, and your teachers. Okay.


Make this a good one.


Thank you. We got a lot of good-looking men in this audience, don’t we huh. And a lot of good-looking women also, by the way. Thank you very much. Okay, go ahead.


They’re gone.


And you know what I’ll do? And I’m pretty good at this stuff. Sometimes you get it wrong. I’m going to put you on that task force. I think it’s good. Not going to do better than him. I’ll put you on. Make sure you give the name. Beautiful [inaudible 00:55:15]. I have your approval?


I have your approval? We’re not going to get better than him. You’re right about it. You’re right. 100%. Thank you.


Well I just want to say that it was very important that I got to North Carolina. Lara, my daughter-in-law gave me the most beautiful grandchildren. But Lara’s here, I don’t know, is she right here or where is Lara? Would you come out here. Come on up here. Come on. She comes from right around here, and she loves this state. And you better be careful because I’m going to blame her if anything happens in this state.


I have to thank you because you gave me a really a great daughter-in-law. She’s really special and she’s along with Michael who’s here, Michael Whatley. They’re essentially the co-chairman of the Republican party. This is a very upwardly mobile person. She’s doing good, but you know the truth. She’s so good I’m very conscious of nepotism. But what I did with her, all I did was recommended, and everybody couldn’t believe she’s even doing it. She is really a person that’s incredible, respected by everybody. They love her. She comes from here and there’s no place she likes better than North Carolina. So get out there and vote in honor of this wonderful person. Where’s Michael? Will you get up here, Michael, please. Don’t worry about the time, the networks will stay with us, right? Michael, would you say a few words.(58:11)So Michael Whatley, I mean I guess I like North Carolina because he was the head of the Republican party. We won the state twice, and last time when all of a sudden around three or two in the morning we started to fall off on a lot of things, it was ridiculous. But with this state there was no fall off. He had 602 lawyers working for him. And I said, “Who the hell is the guy that did such a good job in North Carolina?” Because we were leading in Pennsylvania, we were leading all the way along, and these people will do it, they have no shame. And he did the job and I said, “I want to get him.” And he’s chairman of essentially the Republican party, and I just want to say you’re doing a great job. But I don’t want to say it too early. Let’s wait till November 6th. I want to wait till the morning after, right. Then I feel confident that we’ll say it. But, so Michael is from North Carolina. He was the head of your party and he did a great job, and it went to the top. And please say a few words Michael.


Thank you Michael. Thank you everybody. Thank you. Thank you everybody from Fort Bragg. Thank you.
